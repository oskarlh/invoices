# Welcome to my Storybook for the invoicing app's reusable components

## About Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states which can be revisited during development, testing, or QA. Browse stories by navigating to them in the sidebar.

## Dark mode

The components use different colors if your are using a dark theme in your operating system.

## Language

Some of the components will render in Swedish or English depending on your preferred page language configured in your browser settings. You can test different languages by clicking the globe icon in the toolbar.
